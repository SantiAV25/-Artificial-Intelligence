The repository is dedicated to showcasing all the machine learning and deep learning exercises that I have undertaken.

There are multiple exercises that I've completed from various courses, as well as projects I've undertaken solely for learning purposes. Below is a list that will redirect you to the respective source of each project. Additionally, within each Jupyter notebook, you'll find a description explaining the content of that particular project.
